False positives can have major effects, such as psychological discomfort, exposure to dangerous tests, or increased financial costs due to unnecessary diagnostic treatments. In this scenario, the F-measure is recommended because it takes into account both true and false positives. Furthermore, to ensure that the test's precision is as high as possible in order to reduce the number of false positives, you can prioritize the F-measure if the follow-up procedures following a positive test are costly, invasive, or dangerous."
